    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We build structured, automation-driven verification environments — blending engineering precision with AI adaptability.</p>
  </header>

  <div class="about-grid">
    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Verification & Testbench</h3>
      <p>We specialize in UVM-based testbench architecture — from stimulus generation and assertions to coverage closure and regression automation. Each environment is modular, reusable, and designed for scale.</p>
      <div class="more">
        <p>Our methodology ensures every testbench follows a layered, rules-driven design — simplifying debug and reducing bring-up time for new engineers.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="about-card">
      <h3>Protocol & IP Validation</h3>
      <p>We develop reusable verification IPs for SPI, APB, AHB, AXI, and JTAG — with integrated monitors, agents, and checkers. Each VIP aligns with protocol specs and includes regression-ready test suites.</p>
      <div class="more">
        <p>Our approach enforces clean layering, protocol-aware stimulus, and self-checking transactions that accelerate IP reuse and reduce verification overhead.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="about-card">
  <h3>AI-Assisted Verification Research</h3>
  <p>
    We are exploring the intersection of design verification and machine learning — 
    developing methods that use data-driven insights to guide test selection, 
    regression optimization, and coverage prediction.
  </p>
  <div class="more">
    <p>
      Our ongoing research focuses on building interpretable, rule-based models 
      that complement human verification expertise rather than replace it. 
      The goal is to make UVM environments more predictable, debuggable, 
      and efficient through measurable, data-aware automation.

      <p class="review-text">“Raghu is an excellent verification engineer — both in functional and DFT. It’s rare to find someone who not only understands DFT techniques but can also perform DFT verification effectively.”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— Atchyuth Krishna Gorti, Principal Hardware Engineer, Tesla</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“Raghu worked as a DV engineer for our team across two projects over many years. During his time, he mainly focused on UVM Block Level DV of our external interfaces, but he also helped us in many other areas such as: top level RTL & GLS verification, code coverage analysis, and ramping up other new engineers. He was easy to work with and the blocks he worked on came back from the fab with no critical bugs. I would love to work with Raghu again in the future.”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— David Du, Senior Director of Engineering, IC Design, NXP Semiconductor</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“I  thank  Raghu for the hard work to develop and verify the PCIe gen5.0 CXL bring-up & constraints handoff.  There were many challenges and Raghu diligently work through each of them on a demanding schedule.  Raghu helped greatly to push Synopsys IP vendor while also adapting  meet the particular needs of our environment.  Your efforts on this are greatly appreciated!”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— James Bandy Sr. Design Manager, Maxlinear Inc</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“Raghu was responsible for DFT implementation for a complex interface IP subsystem while working in the team that I managed. He worked with the customer to understand the requirements and architected a solution using state-of-the-art compression techniques. Raghu developed the DFT insertion scripts from scratch and achieved target ATPG coverage. Raghu also helped develop scan mode timing constraints and set up gate-level pattern simulations. Raghu completed all the work on time and ensured that the customer could seamlessly integrate the subsystem in their SoC.”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— Shoumik Maiti Design Manager, Synopsys</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“I’m happy to recommend Raghu for Design Verification. I’ve worked directly with Raghu in the past few years, and can attest to his abilities to do a complete and thorough job. He complete rewrote the test environments for several IPs, achieved complete coverage, resulting in bug free silicon.”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— Brian Flanagan Master Engineer, NXP</p>
    </div>

    <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“I reached to Brunda for a contracting position. She did exactly what we need, and an asset to the team. I recommend for any verification role.”</p>
      <p class="review-author">— Steve, Design Manager, Dialog Semi-Conductor</p>
    </div>

  <div class="review">
      <p class="review-text">“I had the pleasure of working with Raghu while he was at Aeva. Raghu was responsible for verifying the High-Speed and Low-Speed Analog Front End blocks of the SoC. He worked with the 3rd part IP vendor to fully understand the block and created comprehensive test plans for both the blocks and UVM test benches to verify the blocks. He was able to achieve close to 100% coverage on the blocks. Raghu completed his tasks on time and was very detailed when doing the knowledge transfer. I would recommend Raghu for any DV role and would not hesitate to work with him again.”</p>
